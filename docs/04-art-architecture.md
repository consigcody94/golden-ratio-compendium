| **Debunked** | No supporting evidence |

## Ancient Architecture

### The Parthenon — **DEBUNKED**

#### The Claim
"The Parthenon facade fits perfectly within a golden rectangle."

#### The Reality
According to architectural historian George Markowsky:

- Measurements vary depending on which points are chosen
- The ratio of height to width is approximately **1.71**, not 1.618
- Ancient Greek texts never mention the golden ratio in architecture
- The claim originated in the 19th century, not antiquity

#### Why It Persists
- Images often add extra space to force the fit
- Measurements are taken selectively
- It makes a good story

### The Great Pyramid of Giza — **DEBUNKED**

#### The Claim
"The pyramid's dimensions encode the golden ratio."

#### The Reality
- Slant height / half-base ≈ 1.619 (close, but...)
- Ancient Egyptians used the **seked** (slope ratio), not φ
- No Egyptian documents reference the golden ratio
- Any large structure has countless measurable ratios

#### What Egyptians Actually Used
The pyramid uses a seked of 5.5 palms per cubit, giving a slope of about 51.84°. This produces a ratio close to φ, but **coincidentally**.

## Renaissance Art

### Leonardo da Vinci — **DEBUNKED**

#### The Vitruvian Man
Common claim: "The Vitruvian Man encodes the golden ratio."

Reality:
- The proportions are based on Vitruvius's text (1st century BCE)
- Vitruvius never mentioned the golden ratio
- Measurements of the drawing don't produce φ precisely
- Da Vinci's notebooks contain no references to using φ

#### The Mona Lisa
Common claim: "The composition follows golden ratio proportions."

Reality:
- No documentation from Leonardo mentions this
- Various "analyses" use different reference points
- Confirmation bias: you can find ratios near 1.6 anywhere

#### De Divina Proportione
Leonardo illustrated Pacioli's book about the golden ratio, but:
- The illustrations are of geometric solids, not art theory
- Pacioli never claimed artists should use φ for beauty
- The book is primarily about mathematics

### Michelangelo — **NO EVIDENCE**

No documentation exists showing Michelangelo used the golden ratio. The Sistine Chapel and David have been analyzed retroactively, but without historical support.

### Raphael — **NO EVIDENCE**

Similar situation to other Renaissance artists.

## Verified Intentional Use

### Le Corbusier's Modulor — **VERIFIED**

Le Corbusier (1887-1965) explicitly developed and used a proportioning system based on the golden ratio.

#### The Modulor System

```
Based on a 6-foot (1.83m) man with raised arm:
- Height divisions at golden ratio intervals
- Two interlocking Fibonacci sequences
- Red series: based on navel height (1.13m)
- Blue series: based on full height with arm raised (2.26m)
```

#### Buildings Using the Modulor
| Building | Location | Year |
|----------|----------|------|
| Unité d'Habitation | Marseille | 1952 |
| Chandigarh Capitol | India | 1963 |
| Villa Savoye | Poissy | 1931 |
| Notre Dame du Haut | Ronchamp | 1955 |

#### Assessment
- **Verified** intentional use
- Debated whether it improves design
- Interesting experiment in proportioning systems

### Piet Mondrian — **VERIFIED**

Mondrian explicitly studied the golden ratio, though not all works follow it strictly.

### Salvador Dalí — **VERIFIED**

*The Sacrament of the Last Supper* (1955):
- Canvas is a golden rectangle
- Dodecahedron in background (related to φ)
- Documented intentional use

## Modern Architecture

### United Nations Headquarters — **CLAIMED**

The Secretariat building has proportions approximating the golden ratio, but no documentation confirms this was intentional.

### Toronto CN Tower — **CLAIMED**

Some claim the observation deck divides the tower height in the golden ratio. This may be coincidental.

### Modern Buildings Using Golden Ratio

Some contemporary architects have intentionally incorporated φ:
- Various private residences
- Museum designs
- Academic buildings

However, specific documentation is often lacking.

## Music and Composition

### Verified Examples

#### Béla Bartók
*Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta* (1936):
- Climax occurs at bar 55 (Fibonacci number)
- Structural divisions at Fibonacci intervals
- Documented intentional use

#### Claude Debussy
Some analyses suggest Fibonacci proportions in works like *La Mer*, though documentation of intent is sparse.

### Claimed Examples

#### Mozart's Piano Sonatas
Claims that exposition/development ratios approximate φ:
- K. 279: 38 bars / 62 bars = 0.613 (close to 0.618)
- But many sonatas don't follow this pattern
- No documentation of Mozart using this intentionally

#### Bach
Various analyses claim Fibonacci proportions in fugues. Evidence is circumstantial.

## Photography and Film

### Rule of Thirds vs. Golden Ratio

The **Rule of Thirds** (divides frame into 9 equal parts) is a **simplification** of the golden ratio:

| Aspect | Rule of Thirds | Golden Ratio |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Divisions | 1:1:1 | 1:0.618:1 |
| Intersections | 4 equal points | 4 unequal points |
| Ease of use | Simpler | More complex |

### Golden Spiral in Composition

Photographers sometimes use the golden spiral overlay:
- Subject placed at spiral center
- Leading lines follow the curve
- Creates dynamic composition

Available in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.

## Critical Analysis

### Why Are So Many Claims Wrong?

1. **Retroactive fitting**: Analysts look for φ after the fact
2. **Measurement flexibility**: Choose convenient reference points
3. **Proximity bias**: Ratios of 1.5-1.7 are common; 1.618 is cherry-picked
4. **No alternative hypothesis**: What if the ratio is 1.55 or 1.7?
5. **Citation chains**: Claims are repeated without verification

### What Artists Actually Used

#### Classical Proportioning Systems
- **Greek**: Canon of Polykleitos (8 heads = body height)
- **Roman**: Vitruvian proportions (geometric ratios)
- **Medieval**: Ad Quadratum (based on square)
- **Renaissance**: Various modular systems

#### Common Ratios in Art
| Ratio | Value | Name |
|-------|-------|------|
| 1:1 | 1.0 | Square |
| 5:4 | 1.25 | Minor third |
| 4:3 | 1.33 | Fourth |
| 3:2 | 1.5 | Fifth |
| φ:1 | 1.618 | Golden |
| 16:9 | 1.78 | Widescreen |
| 2:1 | 2.0 | Octave |

## Practical Applications Today

### When to Use the Golden Ratio

**Appropriate Uses**:
- Layout grids (with other tools)
- Typography scaling
- Element spacing
- Creating visual hierarchy

**Inappropriate Uses**:
- Claiming "mathematical perfection"
- Forcing all designs to fit φ
- Retrofitting to justify designs

### Design Tools

- **Photoshop/Lightroom**: Golden ratio overlay
- **Sketch/Figma**: Plugins for golden grids
- **Web calculators**: GRT Calculator for typography

## Conclusion

The golden ratio in art and architecture is largely a **19th-century myth** applied retroactively to older works. While some modern artists and architects have intentionally used it (Le Corbusier, Dalí), claims about ancient or Renaissance use are generally unsupported.

The golden ratio is **one of many** proportioning tools available to artists and designers. It's neither magical nor universally superior to other ratios.
