## By Category

### Verified Science
These topics have strong mathematical and scientific backing:

- **[Mathematics](01-mathematics.md)** - Core mathematical properties, Binet's formula, continued fractions
- **[Computer Science](09-computer-science.md)** - Fibonacci heaps, golden-section search, hash functions

### Natural Sciences
Evidence varies from strong to speculative:

- **[Nature](03-nature.md)** - Phyllotaxis (verified), spirals (mixed), proportions (often overstated)

### Arts & Humanities
Historical usage with varying levels of intentionality:

- **[History](02-history.md)** - From ancient Greece to modern times
- **[Art & Architecture](04-art-architecture.md)** - Le Corbusier's Modulor, classical proportions
- **[Music](06-music.md)** - Form and structure, acoustic properties

### Practical Applications
Modern usage in professional fields:

- **[Design](05-design.md)** - Type scales, spacing systems, layouts
- **[Photography](07-photography.md)** - Composition and cropping
- **[Finance](08-finance.md)** - Fibonacci retracement levels
- **[Logo Design](11-logo-design.md)** - Brand mark construction

### Critical Analysis
Separating fact from fiction:

- **[Myths Debunked](10-myths-debunked.md)** - What the research actually shows

## Evidence Classification System

We use the following categories throughout the documentation:

| Level | Icon | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Verified** | ✓ | Strong scientific evidence, mathematically proven |
| **Plausible** | ~ | Some evidence, reasonable basis, needs more research |
| **Overstated** | ! | Kernel of truth but claims are exaggerated |
| **Myth** | ✗ | Little to no supporting evidence |
| **Debunked** | ✗✗ | Actively disproven by research |
